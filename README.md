# Godot_File_Downloader
---


## What does this project do?
This project is a class for downloading files (through http) and supporting a progress bar.
There is sadly no built-in solution so I made this.

## Why is this project useful?
If you ever need to download files with Godot you will find out it requires
some work to make it nice and display a progress bar to your user.

Using this home made class will make it faster for you to create a downloader
in Godot.

## How to install?
